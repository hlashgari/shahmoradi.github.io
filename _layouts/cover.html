        I am a physicist and research scientist, currently at the [Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences](https://www.ices.utexas.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [The University of Texas at Austin](http://www.utexas.edu/){:target="_blank"}. I am a member of the [Tumor Modeling Group](https://www.ices.utexas.edu/research/centers-groups/tmg/){:target="_blank"} led by [Dr. J. Tinsley Oden](https://www.ices.utexas.edu/people/85/){:target="_blank"} at ICES with the goal of developing Multiscale Models of Vascular Tumor Growth.
        
        While my current focus of research is mathematical modelling of tumor growth, I am and have been working for several years in multiple branches of science and engineering, from the subatomic world of [elementary particles] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle), to the microscopic world of biological macromolecules, to [astrophysical phenomena] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst) {:target="_blank"} occurring on the grandest scales of [the observable Universe] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe) {:target="_blank"}. Previously, I worked at the national Institute for Fusion Studies (IFS) and the Institute for Cellular & Molecular Biology at The University of Texas at Austin, as a PhD candidate in Physics, also in the field of Cosmology and Astrophysics under the directions of Dr. Robert Nemiroff -- NASA GSFC scientist and professor at Michigan Tech University -- where my research focus was primarily on the theoretical and computational aspects of Gamma Ray Bursts and their possible applications as Cosmological tools. More information on my research interests is available here.

        I have got my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Physics from Sharif University of Technology -- in Tehran, Persia -- which is considered as the best & the most competitive technological university of Iran and according to some informal rankings, one of the finest universities in the world preparing undergraduates. My B.Sc. thesis was in the area of Particle Astrophysics. To be specific, I investigated the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) & the GeoMagnetic Field (GMF) effects on the Muon Content of Extensive Air Showers produced by the Extremely High Energy (EHE) Cosmic Rays.

        Prior to undergraduate studies at Sharif University, I had my high school education & diploma in Physics & Mathematics at National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents (NODET) & Mofid Educational Institution which are nationally regarded as the best & most prestigious high schools of Persia.
