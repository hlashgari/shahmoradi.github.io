            <p> I am a physicist and research scientist, currently at the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ices.utexas.edu/">Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences</a> at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.utexas.edu/">The University of Texas at Austin</a>. I am a member of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ices.utexas.edu/research/centers-groups/tmg/">Tumor Modeling Group</a> led by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ices.utexas.edu/people/85/">Dr. J. Tinsley Oden</a> at ICES with the goal of developing Multiscale Models of Vascular Tumor Growth. </p>
            <br>
            
            <p> While my current focus of research is mathematical modelling of tumor growth, I am and have been working in multiple branches of science and engineering for several years, from the subatomic world of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle">elementary particles</a>, to the microscopic world of <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macromolecule">biological macromolecules</a>, to <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst">astrophysical phenomena</a> occurring on the grandest scales of the <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe">observable Universe</a>. Prior to joining ICES, I had the privilege to work in multiple world-renown research institutes including the national <a target="_blank" href="http://w3fusion.ph.utexas.edu/ifs/">Institute for Fusion Studies</a> (IFS), the <a target="_blank" href="https://icmb.utexas.edu/">Institute for Cellular and Molecular Biology</a> (iCMB), as well as the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cpge.utexas.edu/">Center for Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering</a> (CPGE) and the Center for Computational Biology and Bioinformatics, at The University of Texas at Austin, either during my PhD studies as a graduate research assistant or later on as research scientist. Prior to getting my PhD at UT Austin, I gained several years of research experience in theoretical and observational High Energy Astrophysics and Cosmology, under the directions of <a href="http://antwrp.gsfc.nasa.gov/htmltest/rjn.html" target="_blank">Dr. Robert Nemiroff </a> -- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA" target="_blank">NASA</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA" target="_blank">NASA</a> <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html" target="_blank">GSFC</a> <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/home/index.html" target="_blank">GSFC</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA" target="_blank">NASA</a> scientist and professor at <a href="http://www.mtu.edu/physics/" target="_blank">Michigan Tech University</a> -- where my research focus was primarily on the theoretical and computational aspects of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-ray_burst" target="_blank">Gamma Ray Bursts</a> and their possible applications as Cosmological tools. More information on my research interests is available <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/amshportal/research" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
            <br>
            
            <p> I have got my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Physics from <a href="http://www.sharif.ir/en/" target="_blank">Sharif University of Technology</a> -- in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tehran" target="_blank">Tehran</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persia" target="_blank">Persia</a> -- which is considered as the best and the most competitive technological university of Iran and according to some <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s957W6jomBc" target="_blank"></a>, one of the finest universities in the world preparing undergraduates. My B.Sc. thesis was in the area of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_astrophysics" target="_blank">Particle Astrophysics</a>. To be specific, I investigated the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landau%E2%80%93Pomeranchuk%E2%80%93Migdal_effect" target="_blank">Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal</a> (LPM) and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_field" target="_blank">GeoMagnetic Field</a> (GMF) effects on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muon" target="_blank">Muon</a> Content of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_shower_%28physics%29" target="_blank">Extensive Air Showers</a> produced by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high-energy_cosmic_ray" target="_blank">Extremely High Energy</a> (EHE) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray" target="_blank">Cosmic Rays</a>. </p>
            <br>
            
            <p> Prior to undergraduate studies at Sharif University, I had my high school education and diploma in Physics and Mathematics at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Organization_for_Development_of_Exceptional_Talents" target="_blank">National Organization for Development of Exceptional Talents</a> (NODET) and <a href="http://www.mecp.ir/" target="_blank">Mofid Educational Institution</a> which are nationally regarded as the best and the most prestigious high schools of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persia" target="_blank">Persia</a>. </p> </span>
